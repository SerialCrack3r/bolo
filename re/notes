# New Features

- New `FORGET` PDU allows systems to completely forget all metrics
  and STATE data based on name, which is useful if you've removed
  or decommissioned a host.
- Common CLI components (including the aggregator) have been
  consolidated into a single, multi-call `bolo` binary.  So,
  instead of `send_bolo`, you run `bolo send`
- `bolo2rrd` subscriber now handles RRDtool 1.6.0 properly.  1.6.0
  is the earliest recommended version of librrd, since it is
  threadsafe and exports all of the rrdcached client functions.
- `bolo2rrd` subscriber now allows you to configure how often it
  will sync the RRD map file to disk.
- New `bolo2console` subscriber, an ncurses-powered interface to
  view states and metric data.
- Preliminary support in `bolo2pg` subscriber for storing event
  data in the database.

# Bug Fixes

- Fix some issues with dbolo splaying / scheduling (#72)
- The `bolo2pg` subscriber now always inserts non-OK states (#77)
- Fix handling of a failed `stat(2)` call in the `bolo2rrd`
  subscriber (#82)

# Developer Stuff

- Travis now tracks CLA status of PR submitters
- Travis now builds from known good versions of upstream deps
  (zmq, libsodium, etc.)
- Source code has been reorganized around better module boundaries
- Starting to libify things, via `libtsdp` and `libbolo`
