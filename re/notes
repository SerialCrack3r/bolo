## New Features

- New `bolo2influxdb` subscriber that can take data broadcast by the Bolo
  core and submit it to an upstream InfluxDB instance, for use in something
  like Grafana.

- New `bolo2slack` subscriber for notifying in Slack channels when
  TRANSITIONs occur (check failure or recovery).

- New `opentsdb2bolo` publisher for consuming data being sent to OpenTSDB,
  and instead ingesting it into the core Bolo aggregator.

- `bolo spy` can now output in YAML format.  Yay YAML!

- Lots of documentation got updated.  bolo(1) now has its own man page, with
  a list of all commands.  bolo2console(8) and bolo2log(8) now have their
  own man pages, too!

- For developers, there is a new `newsub` utility for scaffolding out new
  Bolo subscribers.

## Bug Fixes

- Fix a file descriptor leak encountered when the aggregator runs into an
  error with a corrupted savedb file;  We now properly munmap(2) and
  close(3) the save file.

- Fix `whatis` entry issues that showed up under Debian builds

- Fix a bug in the `bolo2pg` subscriber that caused it to mis-interpret
  broadcast EVENT messages.
