# Improvements

- The `bolo2rrd` RRD map file now indicates the type of data for each DS,
  to make it easier to dynamically generate graphs.  (#84)

# Bug Fixes

- `bolo2pg` subscriber now handles broadcast `EVENT` PDUs (#88)
- `bolo2meta` now properly recognizes the `SET.KEYS` broadcast PDU, and
  tracks it under the appropriate (new) metric.  This fixes a bug
  whereby lots of unknown bogon PDUs would be reported.

# Developer Stuff

- Packaging is now handled exclusively over at https://github.com/bolo/builds.
