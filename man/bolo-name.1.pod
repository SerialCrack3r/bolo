B<bolo name> match NAME1 NAME2

=head1 DESCRIPTION

#INTRO

B<bolo query> is a small utility that parses and analyzes TSDP Qualified
Names (i.e. B<type=sys,host=example01,m=cpu>).  It provides sub-comands for
checking name equivalence (including wildcard matching semantics),
canonicalization (via B<fix>), validation (B<check>) and debugging.

The following commands are understood:

=over

=item B<check> NAME(S)

Check the well-formedness of one or more qualified names.  Evaluates all
arguments, and exits non-zero if any of them are invalid.

=item B<fix> NAME(S)

Parses each qualified name, canonicalizes it (by re-ordering name
components), and prints it to standard out.  Invalid or malformed names will
be skipped, and an error (for each) will be printed to standard error.

=item B<match> NAME1 NAME2

Parses both qualified names and checks if C<NAME1> is equivalent to
C<NAME2>, taking into account wildcard matching semantics.
